# Overview of GFTS System Components

Welcome to the Global Fish Tracking System (GFTS) documentation, designed to guide users through the setup and administration of this advanced platform. GFTS is a comprehensive solution aimed at supporting marine research and policy-making through the reconstruction and visualization of fish tracks derived from biologging and environmental data.

The GFTS system is comprised of three primary components, each serving distinct yet complementary roles:

- **GFTS Hub**: - _Purpose_: The GFTS Hub is a robust modeling environment powered by JupyterHub, deployed on the OVH cloud infrastructure. It is designed to facilitate the reconstruction of fish tracks by integrating biologging data with environmental ocean fields.
  Functionality: Users can leverage this scalable environment to perform complex data analyses and modeling tasks, supported by a suite of tools and libraries within a collaborative and interactive workspace.
- **GFTS Service**: - _Purpose_: The GFTS Service is a web application that acts as a decision support tool, providing researchers and policymakers with an intuitive interface to visualize fish tracks and derive insights.
  Functionality: This component offers visualization capabilities that help users interpret and explore fish movement data, assisting in informed decision-making and strategy development.
- **GFTS Documentation**: - _Purpose_: The documentation serves as a vital resource for understanding, deploying, and managing the GFTS system components. It provides detailed guidance and best practices for both administrators and developers.
  Functionality: Offers structured insights into system setup, configuration, and maintenance, ensuring that users have the information needed to effectively utilize the GFTS Hub and Service.

Together, these components form a powerful ecosystem that enhances the ability to study marine life through data-driven approaches, offering valuable insights into fish behavior and environmental interactions. This documentation aims to equip administrators and developers with the necessary knowledge to deploy, manage, and optimize the GFTS system effectively.
