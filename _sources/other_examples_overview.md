# Example Overview

In this chapter, we present various use-cases, which are tangential to the main workflow.
Here a brief overview of the different use-cases illustrated in the next pages:

- **Copernicus Marine for GFTS** and **Intro to Biologging data** depict a closer look at the reference and biologging data, respectively. On the contrary, **How to summarize the tag data** lets you quickly overview biologging data.
- **_Create Kerchunk catalog for CMEMS_** and its **3D version** show another way to build a reference model.
- **_Read parquet kerchunk catalog_** illustrates how to load an already built reference model saved on the S3 bucket.
- **_Copernicus data exploration_** and **_Reading CMEMS Copernicus data from GFTS s3 bucket_** illustrate how to wrap several reference models into a single [YAML intake catalog](https://intake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/catalog.html#yaml-format).

The rest of the pages focus on specific data visualization methods.

The GFTS project is being actively developed and as such, the following notebooks might be deprecated and their executions are likely to include errors (of various complexity).
