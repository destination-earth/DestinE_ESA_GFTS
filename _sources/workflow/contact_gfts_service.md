# Sending Results to the GFTS Service

Once results have been regrouped into quarters and that that the individual fish location estimations have been simplified for publication, the only remaining thing to do is to send the data to the maintainers of the website.

For that, we suggest contacting the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/developmentseed/gfts) of the application. One way to do it is to open an [issue](https://github.com/developmentseed/gfts/issues).

Please note that the page showing the quarterly regrouped results on the website (accessible [here](https://gfts.ds.io/)) includes a "Learn" tab, where miscellaneous information about the results can be added (e.g., details about the tagging campaign): as such, do not hesitate to provide the maintainers with such information when you reach out to them!
