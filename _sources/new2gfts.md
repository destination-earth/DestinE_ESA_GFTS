# GFTS Presentation

This section is meant to help new users to start with GFTS and its workflow.
The latter involves multiple steps and different types of data (see the next section).
One pivotal package of the workflow is [`pangeo-fish`](https://github.com/pangeo-fish/pangeo-fish), which is reponsible for the estimation of the fish locations.
