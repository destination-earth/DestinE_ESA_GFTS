## Guidelines

Reading our guidelines is key to maximise your contribution, understanding project policies, knowing repositories management, naming conventions, etc.

# Rules of participation

It is possible to participate in the organization of the DestinE project and in the definition of the Use Cases, if part of Horizon Europe or of a project in partnership with DestinE. 
Each use case and project will have its own repository, following the naming convention explained in the [Read Me](https://github.com/destination-earth/DestinE) of the DestinE repository.

For each new project which want to be part of this organisation and fully hosted here, it is required to have the following elements in the repository: 
* Licence
* Rule of participation
* Code of conduct
* Issues
* Code
* Documentation
* List of Topics
* Description
* Link to website page (if available).

For each new project which appears in the organisation but has its own repository outside it, it is required to have the following elements in the repository (XRL repository):

* List of Topics
* Description
* Link to website page (if available).

# How to ask the inclusion of a new project
For the inclusion of a new project is necessary to open a new issue template "new-project-repository-request".
The request will be evaluated by the Community Steering Board and an answer will be given within 15 days.  
After the inclusion in the community each project will manage its own repository and will define the rule for participation most suitable for it.
In DestinE phase 1 only projects which are founded by DestinE initiative will be hosted within this organisation. For other relevant projects an XRL repository will be created.
